### Understanding Ledger Balance

The ledger table provides a detailed view of all transactions for a particular account. Here's what you need to know about the balance:

- The 'Balance' column in the ledger table shows the account balance after each transaction.
- This balance is cumulative, reflecting the account's balance at that specific point in time.
- The most recent transaction (the first row in the table) shows the current balance of the account.
- Each row in the ledger represents a transaction, and the balance in that row shows the account balance immediately after that transaction occurred.

This structure allows you to see how the account balance has changed over time and trace the impact of individual transactions on the overall account balance.
