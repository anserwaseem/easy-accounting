Balance Sheet Flow:
1. Chart of Accounts - Stores information about each account such as account number, account name, account type (asset, liability, equity, revenue, expense), etc. This serves as the central reference for all accounts used.
2. Accounts - Stores the actual balances for each account. This is where the financial data is stored and updated as transactions occur.
3. Ledger Entries - Stores the entries containing the debit and credit transactions. Each entry is tied to a specific account.
